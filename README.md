# Musical Review Setlist Generator
Generates setlists for Broadway-themed musical reviews based on specified criteria.

## Overview

A musical review is a performance of many songs, usually from the musical theater canon. The selection of those songs is largely dependent on factors like the number of performers and their vocal ranges, as well as pereferred stylistic emphasis or variation within the genre. The programatic ordering of the songs is also dependent upon aspects such as energy level and emotional context. My proposed project would take criteria for all these aspects as input and output a setlist suitable for the musical group of the user.

## Proposed Features

1. Module that analyzes inputted singer profiles and determines appropriate songs
2. Module that incorporates stylistic priorities of the user (genre, choreographical aspect)
3. Module that integrates preferred amount of group numbers and how equitably each performer is featured
4. Module that takes in specified length of show and orders songs into a suitable setlist

## Stakeholders and Intended Users
